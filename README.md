# LDTS_G0900 - Run Bird Run!

Run Bird Run is a platformer game and a mock version of the mobile phone game with the same
name (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.runbirdrun&hl=en_US&gl=US). The player controls a lazy
bird that can't fly much without getting tired. The main objective is to stay alive for as long as you can, while
collecting the occasional falling coins. You must avoid the neverending boxes that fall from the sky, otherwise you
lose!
